Be sure to name your repo something without special characters in it because I needed to type the name in to run a command but couldn't because I guess its difficult for terminal to work with special characters. So I made this new repo with your code and my code in it.

As for the errors, I'm gonna make a new branch outside of the "master," branch so we can comment on each other's code their to help out. This makes it to where you can basically have a copy of some code in a place where you can modify it and save it but don't know if you want to keep the modified code for good, so like the "master," branch is your official branch. You copy code from master to other branches to make modifications then can put those modifications on the master branch.

I'm gonna comment on your code and mine in the branch to try to explain.
